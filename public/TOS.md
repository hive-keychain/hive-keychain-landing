# Terms of Service

## Hive Keychain, Ltd.

## Effective Date: January 17th, 2024

Hive Keychain Ltd. ("Hive Keychain", the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") is a blockchain development company focused on facilitating adoption and use of the Hive blockchain. Hive Keychain hosts a landing page at [hive-keychain.com](https://hive-keychain.com/), that provides information regarding the different Hive Keychain products, as well as sub-domains for Hive Keychain's product offerings (collectively, the "Site"), which includes text, images, links to opensource code hosted on Github, and other materials and third party information.

Hive Keychain provides pieces of softwares to certain users, including Hive Keychain browser extension (the "Extension" or the "Browser Wallet"). The Browser Wallet enables users to (i) store locally their Hive accounts and private and public keys, protected by a password (ii) link to decentralized applications (referred to as "dApp(s)"); (iii) perform transactions on the Hive blockchain without giving up custody of their keys; (iv) consult their account history.

Hive Keychain also provides a set of mobile Apps for Android and iOS (collectively "the Apps" or "the Mobile Wallet"), that enable users to (i) access the same features as on the Browser Wallet and (ii) access an in-App browser to directly link dApps to their Hive accounts.

Hive Keychain often adds additional functionalities to its codebase (collectively known as the "Services").

These Terms of Service (these "Terms" or this "Agreement") (i) contain the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Site and Services and (ii) constitute a legally binding agreement between us and you and/or the entity you represent ("you", "your" or "user").

### 1. Privacy Policy

Please read these Terms carefully before using the Site or Services. By accessing this Site, or using our Services and/or Content (defined below) in any manner, you (i) accept and agree to these Terms and (ii) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information as described in our Privacy Policy, available [here](#/privacy) (the "Privacy Policy"). The Privacy Policy is incorporated herein by this reference in its entirety, and all references herein to the "Terms of Service", the "Terms" or this "Agreement", include a reference to the Privacy Policy.

### 2. Terms or Services

#### 2.1 Changes to Terms of Services

We may decide to make changes to this Agreement, in which case we will provide notice of those changes by updating the "Last Updated" date above, posting a notice via [our blog](https://peakd.com/@keychain). Your continued use of the Service will confirm your acceptance of the changes.

It is important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them, because, if you continue to use the Site or Services after we have modified the Terms, you are agreeing to be legally bound, and to abide, by the modified Terms.

If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Site or Services. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Site or Services, at any time and without notice, in our sole and absolute discretion.

#### 2.2 Third-Party Services

When you use our Site and/or Services, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties. For example, our feed prices comes from Coingecko, our Extensions can be obtained by the Chrome Store and Firefox Add-Ons Store, and our Mobile Apps by the Play Store and Apple Store. Your use of those and other third-party services ("Third-Party Services") will be subject to the privacy policies, terms of use and similar policies and terms, and fees of those third party services.

### 3. Eligibility

You may use the Services if you are considered of age in your jusrisdiction of residence, or older, and are not forbidden from using the Services under the applicable law. By using the Site or Services and agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant that:

You are of lawful age, and are lawfully able, to enter into contracts. If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent and warrant that you have legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

### 4. Security

You acknowledge and understand that Hive Keychain Extension or Mobile Apps should not be the primary place of storage of your private keys. Since your keys are only stored locally on the Services, if you forget your password or change to a new device, you won't be able to access your accounts on Hive Keychain. Therefore, your accounts and associated keys should always be stored safely outside of Hive Keychain, offline if possible. All your private keys ("Active","Posting", "Memo") can be recovered using your "Master Key", which is not saved within our Services.

You are solely responsible for the retention and security of your Master Key. Note that anyone who knows your Master Key or Active Key can access, transfer or spend your cryptocurrency. Anyone with access to your Posting key can perform blogging actions on your behalf. If you lose your Master Key and/or Active Key, you may not be able to access, transfer or spend your cryptocurrency.

You acknowledge and agree that Hive Keychain does not store and is not responsible in any way for the security of your Master Key and derived keys and you agree to hold Hive Keychain, its affiliates, representatives, agents and personnel harmless and that no such party shall be liable in any way in the event you lose your keys and cannot access, transfer or spend your cryptocurrency or other digital assets, including but not limited to NFTs and Hive Engine tokens. You bear sole responsibility for any loss of your cryptocurrency due to failure to retain and/or secure your Master Key and/or derived keys.

#### 15. Risks Disclaimer

By accessing and using the Services, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of Digital Assets. You further understand that the markets for these Digital Assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation.

<!-- You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Hive are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. -->

You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your Digital Assets, or any Digital Assets you acquire, including through a third-party exchange may lose some or all of their value and you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens and/or significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and that we cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Site or Services.

The Services and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Hive Keychain to continue to make its proprietary software, and thus, could impede or limit your ability to continue to use the Services.

You understand and acknowledge that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking and other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and the services, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets.

You understand that the Hive blockchain (and all other networks with which the Services may be compatible) remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein.

You acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Site or Services. This warning and others Hive Keychain provides in these Terms in no way evidence or represent any on-going duty to alert you of the potential risks of utilizing the Services or accessing the Site.

Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Services, that intention does not reflect a binding commitment, and the Site and other information available when using the Services may not be accurate, complete, error-free or current. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it in any manner, and all decisions based on such information contained on the Site or made available through the Services are your sole and absolute responsibility. No representation of any kind or nature is made as to the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing or other information distributed via the Site or Services. Pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.

Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.

Use of the Services, in particular for trading Digital Assets, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Services for performing Digital Asset transactions.

All transactions between users of Hive Keychain-developed software are executed peer-to-peer directly between the users' Hive (or other network) addresses through broadcasts. You are responsible for complying with all laws that may be applicable to or govern your use of the Services, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and all foreign applicable laws.

You understand that Hive Keychain is not registered or licensed by the CFTC, SEC, or any financial regulatory authority. No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Hive Keychain-developed software. The Site and the Hive Keychain-developed software do not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity, security, or other Digital Asset or instrument. Hive Keychain is not acting as an investment adviser or commodity trading adviser to any person or entity.

You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of the Site and Services and your interaction therewith. You further expressly waive and release the Hive Keychain Parties from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of the Site and Services and your interaction therewith. If you are a California resident, you waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: "[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."
